Link to the Dashboard: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/f74fc7a4-1e86-48d7-a421-3a3ff32d51f6/ReportSectionfec8b8eb98363d3b61c6?experience=power-bi

Original Dataset: https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-medicaid-spending-by-drug/medicaid-spending-by-drug

Tools Used: Excel, PowerBI

If for any reason the dashboard does not work with the link, a PDF download of it is already in the repository.

This was one of the personal projects for my Data Visualization class (INFO-5602,) where I utilized medicaid drug spending data to show some of the problems in the pharmaceutical industry. I also challenged myself with this project to only use Excel and PowerBI in order to get better at utilizing these technologies. There are three pages on the dashboard: one for overall spending, one for spending on the most common and the most expensive medications, and a final page comparing the most expensive medication (Humira) with different migraine medications. The migraine medications are known for their manufacturers' attempts at keeping their prices affordable for the consumer with different proprietary discount cards and insurance deals, so using them for comparison makes Humira's overpricing more clear.

The class focuses on intelligent use of pre-attentive attributes to reduce cognitive load, so that was a main focus when creating the dashboard. Everything from the graphs to the backgrounds were optimized to reduce cognitive load as much as possible while still showing off Medicaid spending. I also attempted to include significant interactivity to the dashboard to minimize the complexity trade-off created by reducing cognitive load. That way, the people who are more interested can dig deeper using the dashboard while also keeping cognitive load low for the people who are less interested in the topic.
